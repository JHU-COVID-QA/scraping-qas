What is novel (new) coronavirus? 	COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that we have not seen previously; it is not the same as the flu or common cold. Coronaviruses are types of viruses that cause illnesses. These include the common cold, flu, to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERs-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).			CDC

Why is it called COVID-19? 	COVID comes from corona (CO), virus (VI), and disease (D). 19 because it was identified in the year 2019. 			CDC		
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups because of COVID-19? 	There has been a rise in stigma and hate crimes against Chinese and other Asian Americans, as well as people who were in quarantine. This is due to lack of knowledge around how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, as well as gossip that spreads rumors and myths. [[Would you like to know more?]] Stigma hurts everyone as it creates more fear and anger towards ordinary people, instead of the disease that is causing the problem, or towards systems that are not supporting people in accessing screening and treatment. Sharing facts about how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma. 			CDC

What caused COVID-19? 	There are many types of coronaviruses. Some only cause illness in people, and some only infect animals. COVID-19 is likely due to an animal coronavirus being able to infect and spread among people. In the past, there was Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) which are both coronaviruses that came from animals and spread among people.   [[Would you like more information?]] MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient. [[Would you like more information?]] SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents. 			CDC		
What is MERS-CoV?	MERs is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is also caused by coronavirus, similar to COVID-19. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Their symptoms are severe acute respiratory illness which includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus does not pass easily person-to-person unless there is close contact, which includes providing unprotected care to a patient. [[Would you like more information?]] SARS-CoV-2 means Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. It is the virus that leads to the coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. 			WHO		
What is SARS-CoV?	SARS is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It was identified in 2003, and first infected people in the Guangdong province of Southern China in 2002. It is thought to be an animal virus, though the animal source has not yet been identified. It transmits person-to-person, and has influenza-like symptoms, which include fever, malaise, headaches, diarrhea, and shivering. Currently, SARS-CoV is not being transmitted anywhere in the world. Since the 2003 epidemic, it has appeared four times due to laboratory accidents.  [[Would you like more information?]] SARS-CoV-2 means Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. It is the virus that leads to the coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Unlike SARS, in Covid-19, patients become highly infectious before they become seriously ill, explaining at least in part why Covid-19 acts like a super-SARS.			WHO

Why are there two names for COVID-19? 	SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease itself. The virus has a different name for the disease to support the development of diagnostic testing, vaccines, and medicines. The disease is named as such to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, its ability to transmit, its severity, and its treatment. 			WHO		
What is the difference between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2?	SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease itself. The virus has a different name for the disease to support the development of diagnostic testing, vaccines, and medicines. The disease is named as such to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, its ability to transmit, its severity, and its treatment. 					
What are respiratory droplets? 	They are any types of secretions that come from your nose and mouth. This could include droplets released when you sneeze, cough, or talk. Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and faucets.  [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. 					
Where did COVID-19 come from? 	It was first found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first cases are linked to a live animal market but now COVID-19 is able to spread person-to-person. 			CDC		
How does COVID-19 spread? 	It is able to spread person-to-person. The spread can also be through respiratory droplets released when you sneeze, cough, or talk. Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door nobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information?]] Among viruses, some are more contagious than others; for example, measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of ALL ages around them will also become infected if they are not protected. COVID-19 is able to spread easily in the community, which is called "community spread".   [[Would you like more information on how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes Covid19?]] 			CDC		
What is community spread? 	Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.			CDC		
What is flattening the curve? 	Flattening the curve refers to the use of socially distancing to prevent surges in the amount of people who have the illness, that can overwhelm healthcare systems. 			JHU		
Why do I have to "socially distance"? 	Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time. 			JHU		
 Why do I have to stay at home?	Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. As COVID-19 spreads person-to-person in close contact, we want to reduce the chance of infection amongst populations that are vulnerable. This includes older adults (over the age of 65) and those with suppressed immune systems. It is also to help reduce the burden on healthcar esystems and workers, as there are not enough workers and beds to care for patients if everyone were to have COVID-19 at the same time. 					
What does socially distancing even mean? 	It is avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot distance fom others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. 			CDC		
What is the COVID-19 situation in the U.S? 	All 50 states in the U.S., as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have reported presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. 			CDC		
What does presumptive positive mean? 						
Is COVID-19 contagious? Can someone who has it spread it to others? 	Yes. It is actively spreading person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others. 			CDC		
How long do people have to isolate for? 	It depends, and is often decided on a case-by-case basis. The CDC guidance currently says it is okay to release someone from isolation if they have met the following requirements:  * The individual has no more fever without use of fever-reducing medications  * The individual no longer showing symptoms like the cough * The individual has tested negative on at least two tests that have been collected at least 24 hours apart 	Yes, because the guidance might change. 		CDC		
If you have been released from isolation, will you still be able to spread COVID-19 to others? 	Once a person has been released from isolation, they are not considered to pose a risk to others. 					
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine? 	Isolation refers to separating people who are sick from those who are healthy to limit and stop the spread of a disease.  Quarantine refers to separating people who are well that may have been exposed to COVID-19 and seeing if they end up developing it. They may have been exposed to it and don't know, or they may have it and not show symptoms (also known as asymptomatic carriers). This also helps limit spread of disease. 			CDC		
What does it mean to be isolated? 	This means the person has been instructed to separate themselves from others, to avoid spreading COVID-19 further with others. If you live with other people, it will be important to be separated from them as much as possible so COVID-19 does not spread to them as well.   [More information] If the infected person lives with others, it'll be important that they stay in another room, or be separated from others as much as possible. Preferably, they should have a separate bedroom and bathroom if that is available. Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home. The infected person should not care for any pets in the home. Handwash regularly with soap and water or with a handsanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid sharing household items (like dishes, cups, towels, bedding) with the infected person. Clean and disinfect high touch surfaces regularly. Wash laundry througly - especially if clothes/bedding have blood, stool, or bodily fluids in them. 			CDC		
Can someone who is quarantined for COVID-19 spread illness to others? 	Quarantine is recommended for the period of time that it takes COVID-19 to develop after being exposed. Currently, the quarantine period is 14 days, or two weeks, from date of possible exposure. It is 14 days because that is what the period of time has been for other coronaviruses.   Currently, someone who has been released from quarantine is not at risk of spreading it to others because they did not develop COVID-19 during that period. 	Yes, if time of quarantine turns out to be longer than 14 days. 				
Can COVID-19 be spread through food (including refrigerated or frozen food)? 	Right now, our current understanding of how COVID-19 spreads is person-to-person through respiratory droplets. We have not seen anything related to spread through food. For the surfaces of frozen foods and other food product packaging - because of the poor survivalbility of the coronaviruses on these surfaces, it is a very low risk of spread. However, it is important to make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to practice general food safety. Please also continue to wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.    	Yes. Some data has shown that COVID-19 can last 3 hours in the air, several days on cardboard, etc... will find that source 				
Can COVID-19 be spread through surface-touching? 	It can be possible, as people can touch a surface that has the virus on it and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes... but the current understanding of how COVID-19 spreads is through respiratory droplets. 	Yes. Some data has shown that COVID-19 can last 3 hours in the air, several days on cardboard, etc... will find that source 				
Will warm weather / summer / heat stop outbreak of COVID-19? 	We do not know. Some viruses, like the common cold or flu, spread more during the cold weather months but people still become sick in warmer months with them. There is still a lot to learn about how weather and temperature impact spread of COVID-19. 	Yes, if we learn more about weather and COVID-19. 				
Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United Staes? 	The risk assessment changes daily. Currently, all states in the U.S. have reported cases of COVID-19. It is important to limit unnecessary travel and practice hand-washing, and social distancing. 	Yes, risk assessment constantly changing. 				
Has anyone gotten infected in the United States? 	Yes, all states have reported COVID-19 infections. U.S. case counts are updated regularly Mondays through Fridays. Please click here to see current U.S. case count: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html	Yes, if we want to include the actual number in the chat versus linking? 				
How can I protect myself and others? 	The best way to prevent illness from COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus and use good hand hygiene. Common sense precautions that prevent the spread of flu will also help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Please do the following: Stay home if you are sick. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should only be worn by persons who are sick or persons caring for them. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and hard surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.			CDC		
What do I do if I've been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19? 						
Who is at a higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19? 	Older adults (people over the age of 65), those who live in nursing homes or long term care facilities, people who have underlying medical conditions (e.g. chronic lung disease, asthma, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, weakened immune system, chemotherapy, liver cirrhosis, etc), pregnant people, and incarcerated populations. 					
If I'm high risk, what should I do? 	Stock up on supplies, take everyday precautions to keep space and distance between yourself and others, avoid people who are sick, avoid crowds, and wash your hands often. Please limit travel and stay at home as much as possible. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay at home as much as possible and watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you do get sick, stay home and call your doctor.   To learn more about how to prepare, click here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html			CDC		
Should I wear a face mask? 	You should only wear a face mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. Generally, those who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms should wear face-masks to prevent others from the risk of getting infected  Please do not stock significantly on face masks as they are also crucial for health workers and those who are taking care of people infected with COVID-19. 					
I have packages coming from China... am I at risk? 	There is so much that we do not know about COVID-19 and how it spreads, which can be scary. We are basing some of our understanding of how COVID-19 behaves on how previous coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV behaves). Because of their poor survivability on surfaces, it is likely very low risk of spread from those products - and there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 through imported goods.  	Yes, if this changes. 				
Can I donate blood? 	Yes, as long as you are not sick and contagious. Donated blood is always needed, so if you are well and eligible, please consider donating. Blood centers, like the Red Cross, are being given guidance by CDC on how to keep donors and staff safe during this process. To donate, click here.  					
Can my child become sick with COVID-19?	Based off what we know now, childen do not have more of a risk than adults. Children can become sick with it, but most known cases so far have primairly been adults. 	Yes, if this changes. 				
How can I protect my child from COVID-19? 	By having them practice the same things you have to do! Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding people who are sick, cleaning and disinfecting high touch surfaces in household common areas (e.g. tables, chairs, doorknobs, etc.), and laundering items like plush toys. 					
Are symptoms of COVID-19 different in children? 	No. They have the same symptoms, though it may be milder in children. Reported symptoms include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. There is more to be learned about how COVID-19 affects children. 	Yes. 				
Should children wear masks? 	Only if your child is showing symptoms of illness / COVID-19, otherwise no. 					
Can I take my child to the playground? 						
How can I and my family prepare for COVID-19? 						
What can I do to reduce my and my family's risk of getting COVID-19? 	It is important to daily practice actions that will not only reduce your chances of getting sick, but also of those around you. Practice habits to keep you and your family safe.   Please avoid close contact with those who are sick. When you are sick, stay at home - except when getting medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues, and throw the tissue away. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, and before eating or preparing food. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty. Please also clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles). 					
What is someone in my house gets sick with COVID-19? 	Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. If you're sick, stay at home except when you need to get medical care. If you experience difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face... get medical attention immediately. Please keep in mind that this is not the full list and if you're experciencing severe symptoms or something you are concerned by, please contact your medical provider.   If possible, use a separate room and bathroom for the sick household member. It will be important to make sure you clean and sanitize your hands and home (including sick room and bathroom) regularly. Provide the sick family member with clean disposable face masks to wear at home so that they are less able to spread COVID-19 to you. Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, foods, and drinks. 					
Schools, daycare, university - they have all closed down? What can I Do? 	Talk to the schools and facilities about their emergency operation plans. 					
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work? 						
Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19? 	Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is the best way to protect yourself and your family from getting sick! This is important to do regularly - everytime you wash your hands - but especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, going to the restroom, and before eating or preparing food? If you do not have soap and water available, please use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. 					
What types of cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19? 	For disinfecting purposes, most common EPA registered household disinfectants will work. Please click here for link. It is important to clean frequently touched surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, counterops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If your surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. 					
What should I do if there is an outbreak in my community? 	It is important to stay calm and put your preparedness plan into action. Please stay home if you are sick, and limit contact with others as much as possible (with at least a 6 feet distance between you and another person). It is important to stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Please continue to practice handwashing, cover your coughs and sneezes with tissue, and frequently clean high-touch surfaces with regular household detergent and water.   It is important to also notify your workplace ASAP if your regular work schedule will need to change. Ask to work from home or take leave if your or someone in your home gets sick with COVID-19 symptom,s or if your child's school is dismissed.   If you yourself live alone and have a chronic health condition, please reach out to friends, family, loved ones, and healthcare providers. Also ask them to check in on you.   Please also stay in touch with loved ones by phone or e-mail. This can be a lonely and isolating time, so it is important to practice self-care as well as reach out to others					
How do I prepare my child for a COVID-19 outbreak? 	It is important to talk with your child about what's going on. This is a stressful time for both children and adults, and children definitely will have questions. Talk to them about the outbreak, stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If it is appropriate, emphasize that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. 					
What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak? 	Remember - this is a new virus, and there is a lot we don't know. Currently, there has not been a lot of illness occuring in children. Most of the illnesses that are occuring are in adults of working age and older adults (over the age 65).   If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, let their childcare facility or school know. Talk with teachers about their classroom assignments and how your child/children can continue work from home and keep up with school work.   It is also important to discourage your children from gathering in crowds or in public places, and emphasize the importance of keeping distance from others. This is to help slow spread of COVID-19. 					
Why are schools closing down becasue of COVID-19? 	School dismissals are a method that can help slow the spread of and reduce exposure to COVID-19. Please keep up with local news media sources, as they will share information about school dismissals. If schools are dismissed, encourage your child to stay home and avoid gathering or socializing anywhere (like a friend's house, favorite restaurants, or local shopping malls). 					
Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community? 						
What are the symptoms of COVID-19, and what kind of complications can it cause? 	Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death from confirmed COVID-19 cases. Confirmed means that these people were tested positive for COVID-19. These are the symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure: fever, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia in both lungs. Those who are infected with COVID-19 may also have little to no symptoms.   However, if you're experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, and/or bluish lips or face - please seek medical attention immediately. This is not an all inclusive list - if you are experiencing symptoms that are severe or concerning, talk to your medical provider.                                                                                                                                                                                           	Yes, I think if symptoms are included. Also would be nice to link to medical care providers. 		Canada Public Health Services		
Should I be tested for COVID-19? 	 If you have developed symptoms like fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or they have recently traveled to an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, yes. Stay home and call your health care provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions should contact their healthcare providers earlier, even if the illness seems mild. If your symptoms are severe - like you are having persistent pain/pressure in chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, contact healthcare provider or go to the emergency room - it is important to seek care immediately. Your doctor will determine if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested? 					
Where can I get tested for COVID-19? 						
Are there enough tests for COVID-19? 						
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19? 	If you are using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in their sample. In early stages, it is possible that the virus will not be detected. For COVID-19, a negative result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness. 					
Can i go to the funeral of someone who died of COVID-19? 	Right now, there is currently no known risk with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. That being said, currently, we all must avoid large gatherings and stay at home as much as possible. 	Yes, if this information changes (re social distancing) 				
Am I at risk if I touch someone who has died of COVID-19 after they have passed away? 	Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.   We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community culutural and religous leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible. It is recommended that those conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, additional personal protective eqiupment may be needed (like disposable gowns, goggles, face masks)    					
Can I hug/kiss someone with COVID-19? 						
What should I do if my family member dies of COVID-19 while overseas? 	If a U.S. citizen dies outside the United States, that person's next of kin or legal representative should notify the US Consular officials at the Department of State. These people are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergenices.   If the family member, domestic partner, next of kin, or legal representative is in a different country than the deceased person, they should call the Department of State's Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington DC, from 8a-5p ET, Mon-Fri, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends/holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.   In addition to these steps above, the in-country of closest US embassy can also provide assistance. 					
Can my dog/cat/pet/animal get COVID-19? 	While this virus did emerge from an animal source, it is only passing person-to-person currently. Currently, there is no evidence that shows a pet can become sick with COVID-19... but animals can spread disease to people, and people can spread disease to animals. So it is important to always wash your hands before and after interacting with animals. 	Yes, if this information changes. 				
Can COVID-19 be transmitted when a person is not showing symptoms?	Experts believe that this is posisble, though it is considered less common. Canada public health services is currently investigating into this question further.			Canda Public Health Services		
What is the treatment for COVID-19?	Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own. If you are concerend about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms. At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 that is authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19. If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses 			Canda Public Health Services		
Are there any natural health products that can treat or prevent COVID-19?	At this time, there are no natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19. 			Canda Public Health Services		
What's the difference between self-isolating and self-monitoring? 	You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults or people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means to monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms of respiratory illness, such as fever, cough, and diffculty breathing and to avoid crowded places and increase your personal space from others whenever possible.                                                                       You need to self-isolate if you have no symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19 as a result of travelling outside of Canada within the last 14 days or coming in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-isolation means to stay at home, monitor yourself for symptoms, even if mild, for 14 days, and to avoid contact with others. 			Canda Public Health Services		
What is social distancing and how does it help to minimize COVID-19? 	Social distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everydau routines to minimze close contact with others, including:avoiding non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes avoiding crowded places such as concerts, arenas, conferences and festivals limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others			Canda Public Health Services		
Should the general population wear masks to protect themselves from COVID-19? 	If you are a healthy individual, the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID-19.  Wearing a mask when you are not ill may give a false sense of security. There is a potential risk of infection with improper mask use and disposal. They also need to be changed frequently.  However, your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 while you are seeking or waiting for care. In this instance, masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures. The mask acts as a barrier and helps stop the tiny droplets from spreading you when you cough or sneeze.			Canda Public Health Services		
Are you at risk for contracting COVID-19 if you receive a package or products shipped from other countries? 	Coronaviruses generally do not survive on surfaces after being contaminated. The risk of spread from products shipped over a period of days or weeks at room temperature is very low.  There is no known risk of coronaviruses on parcels or packages.			Canda Public Health Services		
I am pregnant, am I at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19? 	Throughout pregnancy, women experience changes in their bodies that may increase the risk of some illnesses, including viral respiratory infections, such as the flu. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19.  It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses and take the appropriate steps to avoid and prevent infection. Proper hygiene can help reduce the risk of getting an infection or spreading infection to others.  If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.			Canda Public Health Services		
Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?	There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus. Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19.			Canda Public Health Services		
Can I get COVID-19 from animals when travelling to other countries? 	Although the current spread and growth of the COVID-19 outbreak is primarily associated with spread from person to person, experts agree that the virus likely originated from bats and may have passed through an intermediary animal source (currently unknown) in China before being transmitted to humans.  It is recommended that individuals who travel to avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and wet (live animal) markets.  If you are considering travel, check the latest travel health notices for the most up-to-date travel advice prior to travelling.  Importers, rescue organizations and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area: they should be closely monitored for signs of illness, you should contact a veterinarian if they become sick, and call ahead to ensure they are aware of the circumstances			Canda Public Health Services		
Can my pet or other animals get sick from COVID-19? 	There is currently no evidence to suggest that this virus is circulating in animals in Canada.  It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that remains to be studied and understood.  Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area.			Canda Public Health Services		
What is the current advice if I am planning to travel? 	1. self-isolate for 14 days after returning from travel  2. monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada 3. wash your hands often for 20 seconds and cough or sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand			Canda Public Health Services		
What should I do if I just returned from a trip? 	If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to do the following: Self-isolate for 14 days after your return to Canada. Some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for certain groups such as health care workers. Self-isolate means: stay home and keep your distance from others do not have visitors, especially older adults, or those with medical conditions who are at a higher risk of developing serious illness Monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing. If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days: Continue to isolate yourself from others Immediately call a health care professional or public health authority and: describe your symptoms and travel history follow their instructions carefully			Canda Public Health Services

 I have read that CV is able to be contracted through the air, how far can it go in the air?	[See answer about how COVID-19 is spread].   COVID-19 is being spread through respiratory droplets that come from coughing or sneezing. If these droplets from an infected person reach another person through the nose, eyes, or mouth it can transmit the disease. It isn't airborne in the same way measles is, but it does linger in the air for some amount of time. However, we are still not sure how long it is in the air for, when the virus particles will rest on the ground or surrounding surfaces, and how it helps transmit to other people.   					
Is six feet a best practice, or is that a 100% safe zone?	Close contact with other people means being within six feet of said person. Maintaining a six foot distance between yourself and others (who may possibly be infected) can help reduce a healthy person's risk of exposure and transmission of COVID-19. However, this is a recommended practice and does not mean that if you maintain a six foot difference from everyone, you will not get the virus. 			CDC		
Any advice about how to minimize risk during grocery shopping trips or getting takeout. 	Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. For that reason, it is critical to wash your hands often, including utensils. Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.			FDA		
Also, what to do if you have no access to sanitizing wipes	IF NO ACCESS TO HAND SANITIZER: wash your hands frequently and thoroughly (this is the smartest thing you can do to prevent the spread of viruses), make sure that if you are able to buy a lesser-known brand of hand sanitizer that isn't Purell, it’s made of at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (C.D.C.) (rules out some of the so-called “botanical” options and popular kid-friendly options), make sure that if you decide to try and make your own hand sanitizer, it also contains at least 60% alcohol. This recipe (two parts rubbing alcohol, one part aloe) sounds like it should achieve 60% alcohol. Keep in mind that some recipes call for using liquor (like vodka), which is usually 40% alcohol, and might not reach the threshold you need. For instance, Tito’s Vodka has been urging people not to use its product in DIY sanitizer solutions.			Wirecutter NY Times		
There have been a lot of mixed messages about kids being 'immune' or 'unlikely' to be affected. Can you provide some clarity around what this looks like for small children?	Currently, children are not at a higher risk of getting COVID-19 than adult. Some kids and infants have been sick with COVID-19, but it is still adults who make up most of the cases we are seeing today. If a child gets COVID-19, their symptoms are going to be similar to the symptoms adults get. This includes: cold-like symptoms like fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea are also possible.   [More information on how to stay safe and healthy] It is still important that your child help stop the spread of COVID-19 by practicing the same things you are doing to stay healthy and safe. This includes cleaning hands often with soap water, or an alcohol based hand sanitizer, avoiding people who ar sick, and cleaning/disinfecting high-touch surfaces regularly. 			CDC		
I'm pregnant... am I at risk for COVID-19? 	It does not look like pregnant women are more at risk of developing severe illness than other healthy adults from coronavirus. Currently, it is expected that most pregnant women will likely experience only mild to moderate cold and flu - like symptoms. 			RCOG UK

Can you answer questions about pregnancy (how will hospitals handle prenatal visits, csections, NICU, etc.) and those pregnant with additional health concerns (gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, etc.)? My OB and sonogram doctors are at UMB and I’m wondering if it’s worth the risk to go to some of my scheduled appointments. Are these nurses and doctors exempt from interacting with COVID-19 triaging and treatment?						
Should I be wearing a face mask to prevent me getting COVID-19?	Masks are only helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus (COVID19) from spreading it to others. If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a face mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to public.   If the person is coughing, sneezing, and exhibiting other symptoms of COVID-19, wearing a mask can be recommended. It is also recommended for those who are caring for someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19. However, masks are only really effective if it is used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based sanitizer.    			WHO		
Can we use fabric masks to prevent the spread? 	Face masks, including fabric ones, are only really helpful in preventing people who have coronavirus (COVID19) from spreading it to others. If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to the public.  What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body. This is because the mask is covering a significant amount of a person's face (namely the mouth and nose). This is the most effective practice when used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  However, these is a shortage of available face masks for health workers - which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.   [More information]    			NYTimes		
There is a shortage of face masks for health workers? 	There are currently not enough face masks for health workers to use, which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic. This ranges from basic surgical masks to respirator masks. Health workers are also being asked to reuse them. This situation makes health workers vulnerable to becoming infected with COVID-19. If you have a surplus of face masks, it is currently recommended to donate that to your local healthcare facility. There have also been call to actions for individuals to create fabric face masks, which can be reusable, to donate to local healthcare facilities. 			NYTimes		
What are N95 respirators/masks? 	This is a type of personal protective equipment that people can use to protect themselves from airborne particles (like respiratory droplets from COVID19) and from liquid contaminating their face. 			FDA		
What is personal protective equipment (PPE)? 	Personal protective equipment (PPE) are types of equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards that can cause workplace injuries or illness. Examples include gloves, safety glasses, shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, etc. This is coming up significantly during this pandemic because there is a shortage of face masks available for health workers, who are on the frontline.
