The CDC recently updated its information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html\">airborne spread of the coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>Respiratory droplets range in size, but in general they are considered large or small. Large respiratory droplets may be visible, and they fall to the ground relatively close to the person who exhaled them — usually seconds to a minute after they are exhaled. Smaller respiratory droplets, however, may remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours, and they may travel far from the person who exhaled them.</p> <p>The possibility of the coronavirus being contagious through the air is why it is so important to wear a <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know\">mask</a> at all times when you are around other people. Masks prevent respiratory droplets from spreading, not only when you cough and sneeze, but also when you are talking, singing or exercising.</p> <p>In addition to wearing a face mask, maintaining physical distancing (of at least 6 feet), hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces are important ways to prevent virus transmission. Staying away from poorly ventilated indoor areas and crowded indoor gatherings are critical ways to avoid encountering a concentration of suspended small droplets and particles carrying the coronavirus.</p> <p>The virus may also be spread by touching high-touch surfaces like light switches, door knobs or handrails and then touching your face, mouth or eyes.

These infectious droplets spread when a person with COVID-19 breathes, talks, sings, coughs or sneezes. The CDC recently updated its information on airborne spread of the coronavirus. Respiratory droplets range in size, but in general they are considered large or small. Large respiratory droplets may be visible, and they fall to the ground relatively close to the person who exhaled them — usually seconds to a minute after they are exhaled. Smaller respiratory droplets, however, may remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours, and they may travel far from the person who exhaled them. The possibility of the coronavirus being contagious through the air is why it is so important to wear a mask at all times when you are around other people. Masks prevent respiratory droplets from spreading, not only when you cough and sneeze, but also when you are talking, singing or exercising.
