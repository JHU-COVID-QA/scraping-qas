However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.</p>\n<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by respiratory droplets released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes.

In private settings with people you donât live with, we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when itâs not possible to stay 6 feet apart. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by respiratory droplets released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes.

Theyâll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you donât respond after a certain period of time.\nHave Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\nWash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\nIf youâre not alone:\n\nTry to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people youâre with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household donât need to stay 6 feet apart.\nAnyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.\nMake sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they arenât using at the moment.\nLet them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\nWash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\nWhenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:\n\nUse one drug at a time (donât mix).\nKnow your tolerance. Use less if you havenât used in a while, or if youâve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\nTest for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\nStart low and go slow. You can use more later.\nUse in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\nConsider getting on medication assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\nCall 802-565-LINK or go to VTHelplink to find a treatment center.\n\nAbout wearing face masks or coverings:\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you canât take your own mask off (like if youâre nodding out), you shouldnât wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.\nMore information:\n\nTips to prevent an opioid overdose (Harm Reduction Coalition)\nHelping during an overdose and finding Naloxone (Health Department)\nGuidance for People Who Use Substances on COVID-19 (Yale)\nSafer Drug Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak (Harm Reduction Coalition)", "ID": "Vermont Department of Health|||-88117233466950261", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "283e52c5-e30f-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "283e52c6-e30f-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1597946476.9698985}

Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection).\nThough antigen tests may be available in Vermont, the Health Department only recommends antigen testing in certain circumstances:\n\nFor people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\nHealth care providers may use antigen testing when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctorâs office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that donât have a lot of PCR tests available.\nAntigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n\nWhen used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\nWe are monitoring how these antigen tests evolve and how results can best be used. Right now, people who test positive from antigen tests are not considered to have a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 and are not included in our total number of cases.

There are ways children can socialize but still stay safe and keep from getting and spreading COVID-19.\nFind more resources for families with children and information from the CDC for children, teens and young adults.\nYou can find information about cases across age groups along with other COVID-19 data on the Current Activity in Vermont data dashboard. More detailed information is in the weekly summaries of Vermont COVID-19 data, which include more details on who has been impacted by COVID-19 in Vermont. You can find out more about testing trends, outbreaks, pre-existing conditions and symptoms of Vermonters with COVID-19.", "ID": "Vermont Department of Health|||594988001735852814", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "545cd27d-961f-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "7148f1b2-187e-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1603821680.7860422}

Schools are encouraged to call the Health Department when learning of a positive test result.\nThe Health Department will:\n\nContact the person who tested positive (or their parent/guardian), ask them questions about their recent activities and who theyâve been in close contact with, and give instructions on staying home.\nNotify the school if the person who tested positive is associated with a school.\nSchools do not need to take action if the Health Department determines that there is no risk of further spread at the school. For example, if the person with COVID-19 was not at school during their infectious period, there would not have been an opportunity to spread the virus to others at school.\nWork closely with the school to identify close contacts at school (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) of the person who tested positive with COVID-19 during their infectious period.\nDiscuss next steps with school administration, including whether to temporarily close the classroom for in-person instruction. These decisions are made on a case by case basis. The Health Department will provide guidance based on a number of factors, including the level of community transmission, the number of students or staff infected, the status of contact tracing, the number of days the infectious person was at school, infection control policies and practices, the number and structure of classes, pods, or grades affected, and other opportunities for transmission, like extra-curricular activities.\n\nThe school will:\n\nClose off any areas where the person spent longer than 15 minutes (like a classroom, gym, or a cafeteria) then clean and disinfect the areas.\nCommunicate with parents and staff about the situation.\nSupport the Health Departmentâs efforts by notifying people associated with the school who have been identified as close contacts. The school will provide them with Health Department guidance and information on quarantine and testing.

This includes all inside and outside social, recreational and entertainment gatherings, and in public and private spaces. For example, this means you cannot go over to a family member or friendâs house or go to a restaurant with someone you donât live with.\nVisitors to Vermont cannot gather with Vermonters or with people from another traveling group. This includes sharing lodging with another household or traveling group.

They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe â to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) Those contacts might include family members, co-workers or health care providers. <strong>Please note, the Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a âroboâ (computer-generated voice) call.</strong></p>\n<p>The team then gets in touch with those contacts and provides health guidance on <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19</a>.

This system will allow us to offer people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts, to enroll in a text-based system to help us keep in touch and monitor their symptoms.</p>\n<p>As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

Itâs also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nIf you are identified as a close contact, you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your childâs school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home.\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out what you need to do if you are a close contact.\nItâs important to answer the call and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus. Governor Scottâs Executive Order calls on Vermonters to comply with all contact tracing requests.\nAll restaurants and other businesses are keeping a 30-day log of employee and guest names and contact information in case contact tracing is needed.\nConsider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

We are also collaborating with community organizations and other partners to make sure people who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, including Black, Indigenous and people of color, have equitable access to the vaccine.\nYou can find a map of the areas where vaccination sites are, not actual locations.
