In other words, it measures the bodyâs immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the bodyâs immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the testâs effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.</p>\n<p>With any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results â false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests.

These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.</p>\n<p>In general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.</p>\n<p>There is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you donât live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How big the space is</strong> â Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.</li>\n<li><strong>How many people are in the room or area</strong> â A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.</li>\n<li><strong>How much ventilation there is</strong> â Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air.

These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you donât live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\nHow big the space is â Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\nHow many people are in the room or area â A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\nHow much ventilation there is â Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. If it is too cold outside to open windows, then setting up a fan to pull air out of the room can reduce your risk. However, using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\nHow humid the room or area is - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter.

Another person can become infected if they inhale the droplets, or if droplets land in their nose or mouth.\nCOVID-19 can sometimes spread through airborne transmission\nAs the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away.\nThis airborne transmission is uncommon, but has occurred in situations such as indoors when a person with COVID-19 had symptoms and been coughing for longer than 30 minutes. Other examples include shouting, singing or exercising, or being in a building without proper ventilation that allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\nCOVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects.

At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.\nStay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\nWear a mask anytime you are around people you donât live with.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer.

We would also conduct contact tracing and recommend a more accurate diagnostic test to confirm the positive result.</p>\n<p>Antigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the coronavirus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.</p>\n</div>", "answerText": "An antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\nAntigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:\n\nFor people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\nHealth care providers may use antigen testing when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctorâs office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that donât have a lot of PCR tests available.\nAntigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\nFor surveillance purposes, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.\n\nWhen used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\nAntigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\nLearn more:\n\nUse of Antigen Testing in Vermont â Health Update October 1, 2020\nCoronavirus testing basics from the Food and Drug Administration\nConsiderations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.", "ID": "Vermont Department of Health|||-800846375862858504", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "00b6d556-c5fc-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "3715957e-7ab8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1614621709.6807835}
