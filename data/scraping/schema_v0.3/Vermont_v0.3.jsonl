They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe â to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.)

This includes the use of technology to help in these efforts. We will be using an app called SARA Alert, a secure monitoring and reporting system for public health that is being used in other states. This system will allow us to offer people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts, to enroll in a text-based system to help us keep in touch and monitor their symptoms.</p>\n<p>As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\nAntigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:\n\nFor people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\nHealth care providers may use antigen testing when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctorâs office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that donât have a lot of PCR tests available.\nAntigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\nFor surveillance purposes, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.\n\nWhen used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\nAntigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\nLearn more:\n\nUse of Antigen Testing in Vermont â Health Update October 1, 2020\nCoronavirus testing basics from the Food and Drug Administration\nConsiderations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.", "ID": "Vermont Department of Health|||-800846375862858504", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "00b6d556-c5fc-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "3715957e-7ab8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1614621709.6807835}

Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.\nHowever, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth.\nMake sure your face shield fits properly. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shieldâs headpiece. Clean them regularly â especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield â and handle them like masks when putting them on or removing them.\nPeople who have trouble breathing can wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom, or a face shield.\nOutdoor workers who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a mask when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people).

Vermontâs numbers are too small to make any conclusions about the role of variants and the infections among fully vaccinated people that we are seeing.

Learn more about vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds.\nLearn more about why younger children canât get vaccinated yet, and how to make an appointment for 12 to 17-year-olds.\nTesting\nChildren 12 months or older can get tested at a Health Department testing site if they do not have symptoms. Infants under 12 months can get tested at their health care providerâs office. Anyone under 18 should be accompanied by a parent or guardian or bring a signed parental consent form. Learn more about getting tested for COVID-19.\nIf your child has symptoms of COVID-19, do not go to a testing site. Talk to their health care provider about getting tested. If your child doesn't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest federally qualified health center or one of Vermont's free & referral clinics.\nSocial Gatherings\nFind out the current limits on gatherings and events.\nWhen gathering with other households, itâs safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of spreading or getting COVID-19.\nWhen you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you canât maintain a 6-foot distance, whether you are vaccinated or not.\nParental Shared Custody\nWe encourage you to choose the form of travel with the lowest risk when you can, which is your personal vehicle. The CDC requires everyone to wear masks when using public transportation.\nChildren in shared custody that are in isolation because they have tested positive for COVD-19, or are in quarantine because they were identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, may isolate or quarantine in either household. It does not affect the shared custody schedule. However, this means that members of the household where the child is staying may need to quarantine. If the child is in isolation, household members will be required to quarantine. If the child is in quarantine, household members would not need to also quarantine, unless the child tests positive for COVID-19.\nPrevention\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n6-Foot Spaces: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\nMasks on Faces: Will people wear masks?\nUncrowded Places: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk.

Heart conditions associated with COVID-19 include inflammation and damage to the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, or inflammation of the covering of the heart, known as pericarditis. These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. Heart damage may be an important part of severe disease and death from COVID-19, especially in older people with underlying illnesses. Heart damage like this might also explain some frequently reported long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart palpitations.</p>\n<p>The risk of heart damage may not be limited to older and middle-aged adults. For example, young adults with COVID-19, including athletes, can also suffer from myocarditis. Severe heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare. There may be more cases of mild effects of COVID-19 on the heart that can be diagnosed with special imaging tests, including in younger people with mild or minimal symptoms; however, the long-term significance of these mild effects on the heart are unknown.
