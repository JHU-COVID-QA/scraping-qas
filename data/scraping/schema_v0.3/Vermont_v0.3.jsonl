Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need.\n\n\nChoose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.\n\n\nMake sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine. Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.\n\n\nGet support from others.
