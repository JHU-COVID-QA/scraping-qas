Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants.

COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact, mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Therefore, if the person feeding the baby by breast or bottle is COVID+, he/she should wear a face mask or mouth/nose covering and wash their hands before each feeding, as well as during breast milk pumping and/or any bottle preparation, to reduce the risk of transmission.

There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible. People who are pregnant, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves and others. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness. In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.vii Follow the below guidance to reduce risks of spread. • Frequently wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. • Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when handwashing is unavailable. • Clean commonly used surfaces (e.g., cell phones, personal electronic devices, remote controls, countertops, cabinet handles, tables, doorknobs, light switches) regularly with disinfectant (pregnant women should wear gloves or use green (natural, eco-friendly) products with disinfectant agent, or ideally have another household member clean the surface when possible). • Avoid contact with sick people. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. • Cover your coughs (coughing into your elbow). • If you or your family has not yet received vaccines for Influenza, get vaccinated now. • Practice social distancing and staying at home: o Only go out for essential items. o Avoid gathering in groups, if possible. o Keep distance of 6 feet, if you must go out. o Limit contact with other individuals as much as practicable. • Wear masks or cloth face coverings at work and in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2 due to risk of suffocation and strangulation. Try to avoid being around others who are not wearing masks.

There have been a very small number of newborns who have tested positive after being born to a mother with COVID-19, but due to an extremely small number of cases, studies still have not determined when the newborn became infected with the virus. It is unclear if it occurred in the womb, during the birthing process, or immediately after birth. The virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood or breastmilk.

It is critical that appropriate precautions are taken after delivery to prevent the spread of the virus from the mother to the infant. At this time, experts say there is no need to change the timing or method (cesarean vs. vaginal) of delivery to decrease the risk of spread to the infant.vii Most newborns who have tested positive for COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and have recovered fully. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe illness.i In the rare case of infant death, it has not been determined if it was due to the virus or other underlying (original, or already existing) conditions. Current data [gathered through case reviews and the Perinatal COVID-19 Registry] suggest that approximately 2-5% of infants born to women with COVID-19 near the time of delivery have tested positive in the first 24-96 hours after birth. [It is] not yet know[n] if any of the newborns reported to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Registry have become ill at home following hospital discharge. There are few case series of pediatric COVID-19 published to date, but clinicians and families should be aware that there are published reports of infants requiring hospitalization before one month of age due to severe COVID-19 infection.vi Although there is much that is still unknown about this virus and its effect on perinatal women and infants, what we do know tells us how extremely important it is for you and your baby to have frequent follow-up with your medical provider/s during the pregnancy, postpartum, and newborn periods. A nationwide study is taking place now to help pregnant women and the medical community learn more about how COVID-19 effects pregnant women and their newborns. If you are pregnant or recently pregnant and are under investigation for COVID-19 or have been confirmed to have COVID-19, you are encouraged to participate in this study.

You are a \"close contact\" if any of the following situations happened while you spent time with a person with COVID-19, even if they didn’t have symptoms: Were within 6 feet of the person for 10 consecutive minutes or moreHad contact with the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, coughed or sneezed on; kissed; contact with a dirty tissue; shared a drinking glass, food, towels, or other personal items).Live with the person or stayed overnight for at least one night in a house with the person. The chance of spreading the virus is greater the longer an infected person or persons are close to someone. It also matters if the infected person is coughing, sneezing, singing, shouting, or doing anything else that produces more respiratory droplets that contain virus or if there are exposures to more than one infected person. Under these higher risk situations, you may want to consider a close contact someone who has been within 6 feet of an infectious person or persons for 10 cumulative minutes or more in a 24-hour period. The final decision on what constitutes close contact is made at the discretion of public health. People who work in healthcare, public health, law enforcement and the meat packing industry may be allowed a modified quarantine, which allows them to continue working during quarantine period while wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), as long as they remain symptom free. The decision to allow a modified quarantine is made by the local health officer. Employees who were potentially exposed to COVID-19 due to exposure to a case should monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including checking for a fever of 100.4 (F) or higher at least twice per day and monitoring for lower respiratory symptoms including cough or shortness of breath. Use this symptoms log. If symptoms develop during the quarantine period, employees should stop work immediately and notify their employer and public health. Isolation of Lab-confirmed Cases of COVID-19 Lab-confirmed cases, including healthcare, public health, and law enforcement workers must be isolated in the same manner as any other lab-confirmed case. Most cases are considered no longer infectious and can be released from isolation using this criteria: 10 days from the onset of symptoms OR72 hours after fever is gone without the use of fever reducing medication AND there has been a significant improvement in symptomsWHICHEVER IS LONGER. In some dire circumstances where there is a shortage of healthcare staff, asymptomatic healthcare staff who are positive may be allowed to continue working if they continue to be asymptomatic, are wearing appropriate PPE, are only working with COVID-19 positive patients and cannot expose other staff, and can ensure that no common spaces will be shared with non COVID-19 staff and patients. This exception must be allowed by the county’s local health officer. If you have questions, contact your local county health department, or KDHE at 877-427-7317. KDHE continues to recommend a 14-day quarantine following exposure to COVID-19, as the incubation period for this disease is 14 days. CDC has released modified guidance allowing for shorter quarantine periods to increase better compliance with quarantine and increase people getting tested. Local Health Departments may choose to opt into this guidance. For information in your county, please contact your local health department.  After exposure, you monitor yourself for symptoms daily or participate in monitoring by Public Health for 7 full days.If you have no symptoms during this time frame, on or after Day 5, you may get a PCR test (antigen and antibody tests are NOT allowed for this purpose).If the test is negative, and you remain symptom-free, you can be removed from quarantine on or after Day 8.If Testing Results are pending, you must wait until you receive results.   After exposure, you monitor yourself for symptoms daily or participate in Public Health monitoring for 10 full days.If you have no symptoms during the 10 days, you can be released from the quarantine without a test on Day 11. KDHE recommends all exposed people should self-monitor for fourteen (14) days from exposure and contact healthcare provider if symptoms develop. Disease can still develop through day 14.
