Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or fingers if you must touch shared surfaces.; Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, and mouth as much as possible;  Although there is currently no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19, you should still ensure that you and your family are up-to-date on all recommended vaccines, including influenza (flu) and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines. Experts are concerned that individuals who get sick with flu or pneumonia, while sick with COVID-19, will have worse outcomes and will be at higher risk of death. In addition, simultaneous outbreaks of flu and COVID-19 would overwhelm the already stressed US healthcare system.
