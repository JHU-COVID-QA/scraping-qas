Molecular tests detect the virus and can be used to directly diagnose COVID-19 and antibody tests detect the body’s immune response to the infection caused by the virus but cannot be used to definitively diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Currently, molecular tests are the only type of tests that can be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. Antibody tests cannot be used alone to rule out COVID-19.</p>\n<ol><li>Molecular Tests: “Nucleic acid amplification tests,” or “NAAT” tests are molecular tests that detect the virus’s genetic material. FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for dozens of molecular tests. Based on current data, we believe these EUA-authorized tests are highly accurate tests.</li>\n<li>Antibody Tests: Antibody (or serology) tests detect antibodies in the blood when the body is fighting an infection. The test does not detect the actual virus; rather, it detects the body’s immune response to the virus. In the early days of an infection, antibodies may not be detected, limiting the effectiveness of an antibody test. This type of test may also be falsely positive if antibodies to a coronavirus other than the pandemic novel strain are present. Because of this potential for false negative and false positive results, an antibody test should not be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. FDA has also issued EUAs for serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More information on serology tests can be found in the Serology section of FAQs on Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2.</li>\n</ol><p>\n</p></div>", "answerText": "There are two different types of tests – diagnostic tests and antibody tests.\nA diagnostic test can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – molecular (RT-PCR) tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.\nAn antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again. Samples are typically blood from a finger stick or blood draw.\nLearn more about the different types of tests and the steps involved in the FDA’s Consumer Update on Coronavirus Testing Basics.", "questionUUID": "d3571fe6-8a3d-11ea-a5a4-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "e0c434ca-b70d-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "ID": "FDA|||-683873720345428549", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "dateLastChanged": 1593108079.0645227}
