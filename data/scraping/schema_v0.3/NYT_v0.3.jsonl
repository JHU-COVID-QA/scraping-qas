Let them amuse themselves.\nThat’s tough: Research has shown that our heavily scheduled lives have contributed to a significant decrease in the amount of free time kids have, so their independent play skills may not be ready for the moment we are facing.\nBut it might really be necessary. “Independent play encourages time management, executive function and organizational skills, and emotional and physical awareness and regulation,” said Dana Rosenbloom, a parent and child educator in Manhattan. “All skills that help us be successful individuals as adults.”\nYou can help them play on their own. Start slow — let younger kids direct play for 20 minutes, 35, then an hour. Keep toys out of rotation, said Avital Schreiber-Levy, a parenting performance coach in New Jersey who has created a play guide for parents on lockdown. “When toys sit out too long, they go stale,” she said. “It’s about making them novel again, either because we take them away or we set them up in a new way.”\nLet kids get messy, and keep play in a specific zone where they can wiggle and jump. And, be patient. If your kid is used to socializing and screentime, self-directed play might be tough for them. Letting them work out the kinks on their own will develop strength and resiliency that can last them a lifetime.\n\n Read More\nNow’s a Good Time to Teach Your Kids to Play on Their Own", "ID": "NYTimes|||5212451395279323379", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "7a197c1a-d67c-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "7a197c1b-d67c-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1596564068.9470375}

That includes part-time workers.\nEligible employees get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a day.\nSome workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.\nPart-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed — including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.\nPaid leave is not for everyone though: Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses. Companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their employers’ low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.\nThese changes aren’t permanent — the leave law expires Dec. 31.

They typically require large vats in which their ingredients are grown, and these have to be maintained in sterile conditions</p>\n<p class=\"g-link\">\n<span class=\"g-read-more\"> Read More</span>\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html\">A New Entry in the Race for a Coronavirus Vaccine: Hope</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "answerText": "The race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus is one of the most important efforts in the contemporary history of science and medicine. In some labs across the world, there is now a cautious optimism that there will be a vaccine for the coronavirus sometime next year.\nThere are five vaccines that have been approved for early or limited use, according to our regularly updated Vaccine Tracker. More than 50 possible vaccines are in earlier stages.  \nIn mid-September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that two unidentified vaccines might be ready by October or November. The technical details of the vaccines, including the time between doses and their storage temperatures, match well with the two vaccines furthest along in clinical tests in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer. AstraZeneca also revealed details of its large coronavirus vaccine trials in mid-September.\nStill, there is little consensus in the scientific community whether such accelerated timelines are feasible. Even after a vaccine is researched and tested, manufacturing vaccines is complex. The process typically requires large, sterilized vats and the mobilization of hundreds of pharmaceutical factories. The record for developing a vaccine is four years (for the mumps). A decade is not an unusual timeline. \nLogistically, it’s also complex. Developing an effective vaccine is just the first step. Then comes the question of how to deliver hundreds of millions of doses that may need to be kept at very cold temperatures.\nBut even if there is an approved vaccine — and even if it can be kept cold enough to reach millions of Americans — polls are finding Americans increasingly wary of accepting a coronavirus vaccine. In recent weeks, President Trump has stated that a vaccine will be ready before the presidential election on Nov. 3, raising fears that one could be rushed against the advice of scientists and regulators. Still, optimists point out, there has also never been a time when so many experts in so many countries focused simultaneously on a single topic and with such urgency. That, alone, gives some researchers hope.\n\n Read More\nCoronavirus Vaccine Tracker", "ID": "NYTimes|||563111758724687918", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "e1e3633a-b70d-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "93719d04-066b-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1601834466.1258042}
