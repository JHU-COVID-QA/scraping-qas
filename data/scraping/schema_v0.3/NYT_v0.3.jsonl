That includes part-time workers.\nEligible employees get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days.

They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.\nPart-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed — including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.\nPaid leave is not for everyone though: Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses. Companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their employers’ low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.\nThese changes aren’t permanent — the leave law expires Dec. 31.

Southwest, for example, has had passengers board in groups of 10, with people only lining up on one side of its boarding poles. United is boarding people by row, with people sitting in the back of the plane boarding after pre-boarding groups. Most airlines are boarding fewer people at a time to keep crowds from forming at the gate, on the jet bridge and as people get on the plane. </p>\n<p>On the flight, things get different. Some airlines are spacing their passengers out by leaving the middle seat open. Some are not. If you are concerned about sitting next to someone and have a choice of airlines, consider their different policies. Call and ask before you book a flight with a specific company.</p>\n<p>When the plane lands, maybe wait in your seat as passengers get their luggage from overhead bins, to keep social distance.

At the same time, some public schools are located in places with high community spread, so many of these districts made the tough decision to start and stay remote only.\nIn New York City and San Francisco, private school students are generally receiving live classroom experiences, while most public school students in both districts spent much of the school year without — meaning that the class divide is determining which children receive in-person instruction. \nMore recently, some public schools that are reluctant to fully open have been pushing to at least get younger students back in front of a teacher — as research suggests that these children are in particular need of in-person instruction.\nBut no matter what kind of school your children attend, if they have been remote for the fall and are returning for the spring semester, be sure you know what to expect. \nAt this point it should go without saying, but again: If your school has a “masks recommended” policy, rather than a masks required one, you’re at greater risk. And old ventilations systems with poor circulation can mean that the virus hangs around in one place that much longer.\nStudents in districts with low community spread will be safer.\n\n Read More\nHow One District Got Its Students Back Into Classrooms", "ID": "NYTimes|||4809702314666899953", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "b54b6c3b-3fc8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "b54b6c3c-3fc8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1608141677.8609746}

Rates of depression were already spiking this summer when the days were long and socially distanced outdoor activities were a given. Now, as we squirm against shorter days and tighter restrictions — both those imposed by local authorities as well as those reinforced by the weather — it is more important than ever to strike a balance between our physical and mental health. (Actually they go hand-in-hand: studies suggest that loneliness can adversely <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/11/29/457255876/loneliness-may-warp-our-genes-and-our-immune-systems\">affect the immune system</a> — making those people more likely to get sick.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These days many of us feel caught between our closing walls and rabbit hole minds.

In June, Americans’ anxiety had tripled and depression had quadrupled between the first and second quarters of the year.

Rates of depression were already spiking this summer when the days were long and socially distanced outdoor activities were a given. Now, as we squirm against shorter days and tighter restrictions — both those imposed by local authorities as well as those reinforced by the weather — it is more important than ever to strike a balance between our physical and mental health. (Actually they go hand-in-hand: studies suggest that loneliness can adversely affect the immune system — making those people more likely to get sick.)\n \nThese days many of us feel caught between our closing walls and rabbit hole minds. So it’s especially important to take stock of your feelings, familiarize yourself with depression’s physical and mental markers and, if you’re uncertain, consider taking this self-diagnostic test. \nAndrew Solomon, a professor of medical clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center, explains that people’s responses to social isolation can be quartered into categories: 1. People who are generally unaffected, 2. Those with minor worry, 3. People now experiencing an anxiety disorder for the first time and 4. Those already suffering major depressive disorder but now falling into a “double depression.”\n \nIgnoring depression can lead to substance abuse, broken relationships — and suicide. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n \nAnd remember: you’re not alone. Since the pandemic, one in three Americans have reported symptoms of an anxiety disorder — up from one in 12 last year. In June, Americans’ anxiety had tripled and depression had quadrupled between the first and second quarters of the year. Young adults and Black and Latino people (who have carried the brunt of the pandemic toll in loss of life and work) are experiencing upticks in anxiety, depression and thoughts of suicide, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 11 percent of respondents noted suicidal thoughts, with those thoughts being most acutely felt by Black and Latino people, as well as essential workers and unpaid caregivers for adults. \n \nFor those most greatly affected, professional help is suggested, but everyone can benefit from routine with time built-in for self-care. The things that brought you calm and joy in the months ahead of the pandemic may not make sense now, says Lucy Rimalower, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. So, be intentional in creating the schedule and self-care you need right now and let it change as your needs change.\n \nScott Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut who spent almost a year in space, has a few suggestions to stave off the boredom and develop a healthy routine — even while isolated. These ideas include keeping to a schedule, getting outside every day and keeping a journal to track your mood and thoughts.\n\n Read More\nYour Feelings … And What to Expect this Winter", "ID": "NYTimes|||-5738238125340154534", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "b46b0ded-3fc8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "b46b0dee-3fc8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1608141677.8609746}

Again, this might also be a yes. But separate needs from wants. You might want a haircut. Do you need one? You want to go sit in a restaurant. Must you? </p>\n<p>3. Can I do this thing in a safer way? This requires some creative thinking, but the answer is also, probably, yes. You might be missing your religious community, and your house of worship is back open. Is there a way to move the service outside, instead of sitting in the crowded room? You’re desperate to see your friends. And you should — mental health matters.

The increasing moves to reopen businesses reflect the immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation’s governors, even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second wave of cases this fall.\nSince the spring, through, a lot of businesses have learned how to welcome customers safely. Temperature checks at the door probably don’t do much, but mandatory masks and limits on the amount of people who can enter at one time do. \nIn general, here are things to keep in mind. If you have a choice between outside and inside, choose outside. You’re less likely to get or give the virus outdoors because it can hang in the still indoor air. And if you have to go inside, wear a mask as you possibly can. \nTo reduce your risk of exposure, consider what most people will be doing at various businesses. Where are people going to feel most at ease, and where will they most want to get close to one another and remove their masks? At a store, you can do your best to get in and get out.\nBut at businesses that exist for socialization, that’s a lot harder. Bars can be loud, and alcohol is flowing. Gyms are inherently germy, and working out in a mask is hard. Dining in restaurants is tricky: Tables are close, you’re eating so you cannot keep your mask on, and waiters keep dropping by to check up on you.\n\n Read More\nA Quick Coronavirus Risk Assessment", "ID": "NYTimes|||-4772774580660713487", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "7a197be0-d67c-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "b46b0dec-3fc8-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1608141677.8609746}

Woods, a Texas superintendent, said, “and it’s going to take years to mitigate.”\nAcross the country, from Houston to Washington, D.C., to Chicago, kids are failing at much higher rates than before — up 42 percent from 11 percent for a normal year in Houston, for example.\nDeclining literacy rates are particularly concerning. An overwhelming amount of data shows that if kids aren’t reading by the third grade, they may never catch up — and they’re more likely to drop out of high school.\nNow, if your kid’s grades were better in the spring but have plummeted in the fall, that’s not necessarily a reflection on your child: Schools often inflated grades at the start of the pandemic in an effort to keep things less stressful as everyone got acclimated. The problem is we’ve still not adjusted and the grading system is now becoming evidence of that. \nOf course, this semester’s grades are generally less a reflection on our children and more on how the school system is handling the seismic shift in education this year.

(Most of these tips are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/work-from-home.html\">good personal reminders for the working parent, too.</a>):</p>\n<p>1. Don’t let them study in bed: If your kids aren’t asleep, they shouldn’t be in bed. Instead, create a space with your children that fosters a good learning environment — one that separates work from the rest of life, says <a href=\"https://donaldrattner.com/\">Donald M. Rattner</a>, a New York-based architect who specializes in creating productive home and office spaces.</p>\n<p>2. Pick a space away from other distractions (like the television) and where they have room to move around. If you can position their desks by a window to let in natural light, that’s even better. Create separate spaces with curtains, screens or an extra sheet. And let your children take some leadership in creating their space, adding artwork, fun pencils or a favorite photo. The in-home classroom should be a place the kids want to be. </p>\n<p>Just be sure that the work space includes all their necessary school supplies. (Nothing wastes time like walking all over the house in search of a sharpened pencil or that long-lost password to login.) In fact, depending on the age and needs of your child — as well as the layout of your home or apartment — you may set up offices as though <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/smarter-living/how-to-work-from-home-if-youve-never-done-it-before.html\">your kid is the co-worker in the next cubicle over</a>. </p>\n<p>You have an important work call, your kid has a test, or maybe one of you just needs a moment’s peace? Signal that. Color-coded cards (green for ‘go,’ red for ‘don’t even think about it’) on the space dividers can signal when each of you can invade the other’s space. </p>\n<p>3. Set a strict routine. Just because you’re not jumping out of bed and rushing to school every morning doesn’t mean that some parts of that morning routine can’t stay the same. Work on a schedule with your children — one that they are happy with and that works with your own schedule (you matter, too!). </p>\n<p>Then help them keep to it. Set a time to wake up, eat breakfast and, yes, change out of pajamas. And be sure to follow the same rules as the kids. No just-coffee-for-breakfast hypocrites in the house, please.</p>\n<p>4. Set daily goals. Sharing these goals with family members can give everyone ownership of their day and create self- and group-accountability, as well as compassion toward others in the house. If people are lagging behind, remind one another of your goals and see what you can do to meet them even after the inevitable hiccups in the day.</p>\n<p>5. Transitions are natural — just don’t get caught up. You can’t be productive every moment of the day. Kids need breaks (and so do you) for snacks, recess — and, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/army-naps.html\">yes, even naps!</a> — to process the day. Build that into the routine. </p>\n<p>6. Get up and get moving. Take breaks to go outside, get some exercise or even just move around a bit inside the house. </p>\n<p>7. Remember to engage with your child. There’s a reason children are always asking “Why?” They, too, are invested in the meaning of what we do day in and day out. And some of that gets lost in a virtual environment. Try to connect their work to an everyday example in which you’ve used the material they’re learning. </p>\n<p>8. Keep in touch with the teachers. Just because you can’t go to parent-teacher conferences right now doesn’t mean you can’t check in and voice concerns or ask for help. This is a school year for the record books. So have compassion for the teachers who are up against even more than usual. (And that’s saying something.)</p>\n<p>9. Keep your distance, too. While younger kids need more help logging on and staying on — their fine motor skills aren’t fully developed yet — older kids don’t need someone peering over their shoulder every few seconds. (And you have better ways to spend your time, too.) If your child needs help and you’re equipped to provide it, then schedule some time outside of class to work together. And be sure to mark an end to the school day. In pre-Covid times, the school bus ride or walk home from school was a nice cue that the day was over — at least before the homework began. But now since all work is homework, when work is finished, find cues for both students and parents that the day is done: Close the computer, stop checking email — you’re transitioning back into the life part of that work-life balance.</p>\n<p>10. Remember, tomorrow is a new day. You might not be trained as a teacher or have expected to be a full-time worker, caregiver and teacher all at once: You’ll make mistakes and so will the kids. Give them grace. Give yourself grace. Give everyone grace again and again and again.

Some school districts have remained virtual, while others have fully reopened classrooms or have remained on a hybrid schedule. But across the country, the colder weather is starting to make it harder to keep students safe, as cases tick up and schools that have reopened shut back down.\nIn October, New York City, which had previously implemented a hybrid schedule, was the first big city to reopen all of its public schools — then quickly announced an immediate and indefinite shutdown in November. A few days later, however, the city announced a return to in-person education, and the tapering off of hybrid learning. (Do you have whiplash yet?) And the start to 2021 has caused only more uncertainty.\nCurrently, only younger students and those with complex disabilities — making up about 190,000 of the some 1.1 million of the city's public school students — are learning in the classroom, with a vast majority opting for remote learning. Middle and high school students, who were welcomed to the classroom for just a few weeks this fall, have no set date to return. It’s been hardly a promising effort for the nation’s largest school system, which has been criticized for lackluster remote learning, creating an ever-greater racial disparity within the school system — and one that school administrators across the country have turned to for an example of how to reopen safely.\nThis winter, more large cities have forged ahead, while others have remained remote. In Miami-Dade County and Houston all students through high school returned to the classroom in October. \nBut after Covid-19 rates surged across California this fall, schools in several counties hit the brakes. The first students in Los Angeles began returning to the classroom in November, as schools serving kindergartners through second graders applied for county-approved health waivers to teach in areas with high infection rates. By the end of January, all students in San Diego are slated to return at least a few days a week. But San Francisco schools remain shuttered, with hopes of reopening in January dashed amidst high rates across the state. \"Right now we are in a surge that requires us to stay home and stop the spread,\" Mayor London Breed said in a statement in December. In an open letter published in January, 30 medical professionals from the University of California, San Francisco, urged the reopening of schools across the state by Feb. 1, writing: “Long term school closures have a detrimental, measurable impact on children and adolescents.”\nAs of mid-January, the vast majority of states — including New York — had handed off the decision-making for school openings to local districts, according to data pulled by Education Week, a news organization covering K-12. Only Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. (with some exceptions) have full closures in effect, while a handful of states — Delaware, North Carolina, West Virginia, New Mexico, California and Hawaii have partial closures, with hybrid instruction sometimes allowed. In contrast, four states — Texas, Florida, Arkansas and Iowa — require schools to offer at least some in-person instruction. (See Education Week's up-to-date map showing school openings by state.)

But the coronavirus is happening right now, and it’s not specifically happening to you or your family. There are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/style/self-care/birthday-party-coronavirus-online-zoom.html\">still ways to celebrate.</a></p>\n<p>With events, you have three options. You could postpone them indefinitely. You could host them over video chat. Or you could have a much smaller celebration — masked up and distanced — with the people who matter the most.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "answerText": "Even with a pandemic raging, there are things some have been lucky enough to celebrate. And you should: Life is short — you just don’t want to make it unnecessarily shorter. So how do you celebrate safely?\nInfection rates have been on the rise as people began cozying up together indoors. In November, the month of Thanksgiving, the virus set new daily infection records: a million new cases reported in 10 days, another million in under seven days — a total of four million new cases over that month. And we similarly saw increases after the winter holidays — with a record 300,600 new cases Jan. 8 alone, just a week after New Year’s.\nSome celebrations are worth delaying indefinitely. (Have you really turned a year older if it hasn’t been celebrated?) Others can be hosted over video chat. Or you can whittle down the party — masked up and distanced — to the people who matter the most.\nAnd if you’re determined to gather, be sure to keep your guest list small. Experts advise limiting the number of households attending. (It’s best not to mix households at all.)\nThe recommended 10-day quarantine ahead of gathering — or even a shorter restriction of your contacts is better than nothing. Experts also suggest driving to the destination while limiting contact along the way, keeping your mask on and doing your best to keep some distance from those not in your household. You could throw a test on top for extra precaution — even for local gatherings. (See below for information about testing to determine the best test for you and when you should get it. And get more information from the C.D.C. about testing here.)\nNo matter the location or style of the event, everyone should wear masks as much as possible when not eating and people from different households should do their best to keep their distance. The recommendation is keeping six feet apart at all times.\nThe best safe-hosting option? Move the gathering outside. Outdoor gatherings are lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, according to Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester. (Go here for some tips on safe picnicking.)\nIf you must host indoors: The C.D.C. has prepared separate guidelines about how to properly clean your house before guests arrive, as well as how to be a pandemic-savvy host.\nBefore guests arrive, open the windows. That can increase the air exchange rate to as much as three times an hour — just half the rate recommended for buildings by the World Health Organization.\nIf it gets cold, you can crank the heater — in fact, the C.D.C. suggests putting your central air and heating on “continuous circulation.” Exhaust fans (like those over your stove or in the bathroom) can also help, but don’t turn on a regular fan — because that will simply recirculate the same, potentially contaminated air and increase everyone’s risk.\nOther ways to lower the risk to you and your guests is to limit the length of your celebrations, keeping shouting and singing to a minimum, and limiting the sharing of serving bowls and utensils. And don’t bother getting out the nice guest towels. This year, paper towels are the way to go. The C.D.C. also reminds us to drink responsibly: “Use of alcohol or drugs may alter judgment and make it more difficult to practice Covid-19 safety measures.”\nDuring the pandemic, being a good host means letting your guests know the expectations and safety standards up front — so no one is uncomfortable by unexpected rules or the lack there of — and have extra masks on hand in case a guest forgets.\n \nBut if you’re truly worried about getting Uncle Harold sick, stay home. It is the surest way to keep him safe.\n \nAnd remember, no matter how far you traveled to gather: If you develop Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, etc.) within 14 days of celebrating or later test positive, make sure to let your host know and follow these guidelines to keep others safe.\n\n Read More\nHow to Celebrate a Birthday Now", "ID": "NYTimes|||-5161849509312155720", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "7a197c28-d67c-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "87d5102e-64b7-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1612202495.4504976}

You could try for a socially distant park hang with friends who live near you. Or, you could host a party over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-birthday-party.html\">video conferencing,</a> which is really more fun than it sounds. Set a time limit, call on people the way you would if you were leading a meeting and decorate your own place. </p>\n<p>You could also ask everyone to bake the same easy mug cake, or something, so it feels like you’re all together.

Start by talking to them about how this year is going to be different. You might want to try for a split-level birthday: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, and online activities with friends.  </p>\n<p>At home, you can build a fort at home together, or try for an ambitious craft project. Try some funky baking project, or give them “magic powers\" for the day.</p>\n<p>For the virtual party, keep it short and sweet. One hour is probably the maximum amount of time, so make sure you give your guests both a start time and end time. The other parents on the call will appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Not sure how to fill time online? You could hire virtual entertainment. There are still music classes and magicians and clowns, and they offer virtual shows.

For those in milder climates, park birthdays (everyone masked and distanced) may still be an option. (For those in colder climates, a park party is a good way to see who will scarf-and-glove up for you — you know, the people who really love you.)\nOtherwise, that virtual party over Zoom can actually be a lot of fun (I’m speaking from experience) — so long as you limit the time and plan simple, interactive ways to get everyone on the call to take part. Don’t pick a time too close to mealtimes — or you’ll lose people to their microwaves. Be respectful of not monopolizing people’s days. And if you’re inviting people from different time zones (after all, this is the year you can have anyone and everyone you’ve ever loved in one — albiet virtual — place), be sure you pick an hour that isn’t too late or too early for the guests.\nIf you’re like my mother and think eating birthday cake in front of everyone (without a slice) is rude, you can suggest they bring along their own favorite treats, so it feels like you’re all together. (Or just plough in, it is your birthday, after all.)\nThink carefully about that invite list: Who knows who, what personalities work well together and what do folks who haven’t met have in common? The simple answer to that last question is: you. So, your next step is figuring out how this group of people can pass the time together, and, again, that should probably be centered on what they have in common — again, you. So ask folks to introduce themselves and (if you’re brave enough) share a funny or embarassing story about yourself. It’s a nice way to get people laughing, talking about someone they all know and (I assume) love, without it starting to sound like a eulogy. You can also end with a short game as a sign off — like a round-robin story where everyone contributes one sentence with their goodbye.\nJust be sure to keep your guests’ tendencies in mind: If you’re inviting a bunch of talkers, you can let people speak up on their own (so long as they don’t scream over each other). If they’re a quieter bunch, you might want to call names – and regardless, that’s a nice way to get the party started. (You can even let a close friend or two know you’re going to start with them, so you can get rolling on a high note.) \nIf everyone enjoys singing or another particular activity, you can incorporate that – but just be sure if you’re an opera star and inviting someone who is (um, well, not), you don’t make anyone feel uncomfortable. (You’ll know when people’s faces start blinking to darkened squares.) And speaking of appearances, just because you don’t have to clean the house, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t make an effort with a nice, festive background – via real decorations or your own Zoom creation.\nFor kids (and more festive adults, too), you can also go for a multi-tiered birthday celebration: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, as well as online or drive-by activities with friends. At home, endow your birthday celebrant with “magic powers” for the day – the chance to pick each meal and all the family activities. (Get ready for a few more sweets and even more noise than usual.) \nNot sure how to fill time online with your kid’s friends? You could hire virtual entertainment. There are still music classes and magicians and clowns, and they offer virtual shows. (The website Mommy Poppins has a good list.) Or, if you don’t have the budget to hire a clown, you could always consider putting the red nose on yourself – and practice your juggling beforehand. (Unless you want the kids laughing at you.) Just be sure to keep any virtual party short and sweet – say one hour, with a start and end time. And to keep on schedule, signal that the call is wrapping up by introducing one final activity – phrases like “before we say goodbye,” or “we have just a few more minutes to do X” will cue that the party is coming to a close. (Both you and the other parents on the call will appreciate it.)\nOr, if your kid feels like he’s at school every time he looks at his friends through a computer screen, consider taking the party to the street. Put a festive birthday sign replete with his favorite color balloons in the front yard and host a drive-by caravan, with celebrants waving, honking and throwing a requested candy from the window.\n\n Read More\nGo Ahead, Blow Out the Candles on Zoom", "ID": "NYTimes|||-5071078580585442571", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "0abe246a-2e7f-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "897855c2-64b7-11eb-8934-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1612202495.4504976}
